<h1>The Best Movies According to Cinnamon</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>As a nonhuman-things lover, it is the hands down the best movie I ever seen. 
    When it comes to Avatar1, I saw this movie when I was a very yound child.
    From that time I've really dreamed of being a member of CG team.
    Anyways, I love the way James Cameron make a scenario and each of every component of Na-vi. 
    Avatar2 is a really cool movie also, every Earthlings were surprised of the scenary of Pandora, especially the life in Met-kaina clan.
    I've really wanted to learn how to dive and swim. I heard that Avatar3 will be released in 2025. I can't wait seriously.

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>This is the one of the masterpiece of Christoper Nolan, I'm really into it.
    The idea and scenario, mise-en-scene, action, etc.. all of them are perfect, I saw this movie at least 8 times in cinema.
    I strongly recommend that you have to see this movie in Imax cinema. Excellant sound and huge scaled screen will be make your day.
    I heard that there's a world class sized Imax cinema in Melbourne. If I can I eager to go there and watch this movie..

<h3>Handmaiden</h3>
<p>I can certainly say that this movie director, Chan-wook Park, is a totally perk, in a good meaning.
